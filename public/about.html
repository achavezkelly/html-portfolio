<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Junior Software Engineer, where I have primarily worked in property management. During
  my career in property management, I realized it was not a space to be fully creative and have a work-life balance. 
  Although the tech industry has its' own challenges and demands, it is always a new way to solve an issue. 
  It is an exciting journey of constant learning and developing new projects that have the potential of solving 
  real world problems.
